								<h2>Introduction</h2>
							</header>

							<p style="text-align:left;">
								Nowadays, wearable devices offer the means to continuously monitor various human health parameters.
								The positioning of sensors on the body is crucial for effective performance;
								incorrect sensor placement can significantly impair the functionality of wearable systems. <br /><br />

								Among these devices, smart clothing has gained substantial attention thanks to its comfort and user-friendliness.
								In smart clothing, the efficiency and accuracy of embedded sensors are influenced not only by their relative position
								to the body but also by how well they fit.
								A loose connection between the skin and sensors can undermine device functionality,
								while poor fitting to the body surface can impact usability.
								Therefore, it's important to evaluate the influence and effects of fitting on the garment's sensing capabilities. <br /><br />

								While various problem modeling approaches were proposed to aid garment designers over the past decades,
								these analyses have predominantly been conducted in static human positions,
								often overlooking sensor errors introduced during movement. <br /><br />

								In this project, our goal is to establish a framework for the automated design of personalized smart clothing,
								complete with integrated sensors.
								We aim to assess how human motion during Activities of Daily Living (ADL) impacts the performance of different
								sensing methods, thereby addressing the gap in understanding introduced by motion-induced sensor errors.

							We designed a framework that automates the extraction of body landmarks and associated measurements from 3D body scans.
								This framework then generates personalized smart garments using the estimated body measurements.
								The algorithm was trained and evaluated using 3000 synthetic 3D body models to estimate the necessary landmarks for T-Shirt design.
								The effectiveness of the framework was confirmed through the automated tailoring of an electrocardiogram (ECG)-monitoring shirt,
								resulting in a shirt that fit various body shapes with an average electrode-skin distance of 0.61 cm.  <br />

							<p style="text-align:left;"><br />
							To evaluate the performance of contact sensors embedded in garments during typical Activities of Daily Living (ADL),
								we developed a simulation method. Using 100 3D human body models with diverse shapes,
								we virtually dressed them up with three differently fitted smart ECG-monitoring T-Shirts.
								This allowed us to analyze the sensor-body distance and displacement during various ADLs.
								Our findings indicated that performance variations were linked to body shape, garment fit, and movement type.

							In future work, we plan to expand this method by considering fabric properties (like cotton or stretchable/functional materials)
								to better understand their impact on fit and sensor performance.
								We also intend to simulate different garment cuts to broaden the method's capabilities and application scope.
								Furthermore, we will incorporate other sensor types such as orientation and strain sensors, along with corresponding
								evaluation procedures, to accommodate a wider range of embedded electronics in garments.
